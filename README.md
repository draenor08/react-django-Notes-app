#  Installation

To get started, you can clone the repository and install the dependencies:

# Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<username>/notes-app.git
cd notes-app
```

# Set up the backend (Django):

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run migrations:
   ```bash
   python manage.py migrate
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   python manage.py runserver
   ```

# Set up the frontend (React):

# Running Both Servers

Make sure both the backend (Django) and frontend (React) servers are running at the same time. You can use **concurrently** or just run them in different terminal windows.

# Usage

Once the servers are running, you can access the app:

- **Frontend**: Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) for the React frontend.
- **Backend**: The Django backend will run at [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).
